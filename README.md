Mini Challenge Two to Four - Endpoints
Created a web api with three endpoints; one to sum two numbers, one to output the user's name and wake up time, and one to compare two numbers to see which is greater than or less than.
Peer Review: Avery Hillstrom
Peer Review Comments: Code runs very well and validates data! The endpoints all work as described and output successful results each time. If you try to enter text values into the numerical endpoints it returns a statement telling the user to check they are only entering numbers. Was having trouble getting data to show up using Postman but that may be an error on my end because the code worked perfectly on swagger and I couldn't find any errors or missing variables when I went through it. Overall extremely solid code with a neat execution, great job!

Pseudo Code:
Sum two numbers
    We will need to accept user input for two separate numbers and save them to variables
    We will need to perform the arithmetic operation to sum the two numbers
    We will need to output a string "The sum of 2 and 2 is 4."

Wake Up Time
    We will need to accept user input for their name and the time they woke up
    We will need to output a string "You are Jerrod and you woke up at 7:30am today"

Greater than or Less than
    We will need to accept user input for two separate numbers and save them to variables
    We will need to perform comparisons on the two numbers (probably if statements)
    We will need to output two strings
        First Number is greater than Second Number
        Second Number is less than First Number
