Pseudo Code:
Sum two numbers
    We will need to accept user input for two separate numbers and save them to variables
    We will need to perform the arithmetic operation to sum the two numbers
    We will need to output a string "The sum of 2 and 2 is 4."

Wake Up Time
    We will need to accept user input for their name and the time they woke up
    We will need to output a string "You are Jerrod and you woke up at 7:30am today"

Greater than or Less than
    We will need to accept user input for two separate numbers and save them to variables
    We will need to perform comparisons on the two numbers (probably if statements)
    We will need to output two strings
        First Number is greater than Second Number
        Second Number is less than First Number
